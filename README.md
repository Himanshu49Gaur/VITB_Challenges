# How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse by Topic or Platform:** Navigate into folders based on your area/platform of interest (e.g., `LeetCode` for LeetCode-specific coding or `GFG160` for GeeksforGeeks common DSA sets).
2. **Read Solution Files:** Each solution is provided as a well-documented code file, often with problem description, input/output specs, and approach comments.
3. **Learn from Explanations:** Many solutions contain explanations or screenshots where necessary to clarify tricky cases or demonstrate testing.
4. **Contribute:** If you want to add your own solutions or improvements, fork the repo and make a Pull Request with a clear explanation in your commit.

## Tips for Effective DSA Learning

- Break down large problems and attempt each part step by step.
- Try to implement multiple approaches (brute force/optimized).
- Comment your logic for easier revision.
- Make use of visualization tools for complex data structures (like trees/graphs).
- Record bugs and debugging strategies to avoid future mistakes.

## Contribution Guide

- **Folder Structure:** Maintain logical folder organization. Place code files in the correct directory.
- **Naming Convention:** Use meaningful names like `problem-title.py` or `contest-name_q1.cpp`.
- **Documentation:** Include brief problem statements and approach for each solution.
- **Screenshots:** Where asked, attach screenshots for input/output or code snapshots.
- **Clean Commits:** Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
